MICROSOFT MOVIES

BUSINESS PROBLEM
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. 

They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies.

Objectives
Exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 
Translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Data loading
3 data sets were loaded separately:
- imdb.title.basics
- imdb.title.ratings
- bom.movie_gross

They were imported as csv and analyzed using pandas library

DATA INSPECTION AND MERGING
- Each data set was inspected separately
- The 3 data sets were then merged using common column keys i.e. title, and tconst

DATA CLEANING
- The column foreign gross was converted to the correct data type: object to float
- There was significant number of missing values in the foreign gross column (38.1%).
- Imputation using the median was done because of the skewed distribution

- Considering the context within which this data is collected is not all outliers were removed. Movies that are doing better than average in terms of income and ratings are worth noting. This is valuable information that should be kept as part of the analysis. There are outliers in run time that is isolated and likely to alter the analysis. These were subsequently dropped
